# Digit-Classifier
Uses Lenet-5 CNN to analyze handwritten digits provided by MNIST database.

This program uses TensorFlow and Keras in order to create the model and train it. The training and testing data comes from the MNIST datase, a collection of handwritten digits.
The algorithm used results in high accuracy and a small margin of error, allowing us to confidently detect handwritten digits in images.
